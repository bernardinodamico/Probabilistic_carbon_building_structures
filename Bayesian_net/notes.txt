These are the query variables we always(!) want to query a distribution for.
Tp = 'Timber_(Products)_Mass_(kg/m2)'
Sts = 'Steel_(Sections)_Mass_(kg/m2)'
Rf = 'Reinforcement_Mass_(kg/m2)'
Cn = 'Concrete_Mass_(kg/m2)'
Mb = 'Masonry_&_Blockwork_Area_(m2/m2)'

These are the evidence variables we might(!) or might not have: none, all five of them or anything in between.
Ct = 'Cladding_Type'
Sst = 'Superstructure_Type'
Ns = 'No_storeys'
B = 'Basement'
Ft = 'Foundation_Type'

Therefore we'll have several probability combinations for each one of the five query variable:

Pr(Tp)

Pr(Tp | Ct=ct)
Pr(Tp | Sst=sst)
Pr(Tp | Ns=ns)
Pr(Tp | B=b)
Pr(Tp | Ft=ft)

Pr(Tp | Ct=ct, Sst=sst)
Pr(Tp | Ct=ct, Ns=ns)
Pr(Tp | Ct=ct, B=b)
Pr(Tp | Ct=ct, Ft=ft)
Pr(Tp | Sst=sst, Ns=ns) 
Pr(Tp | Sst=sst, B=b)
Pr(Tp | Sst=sst, Ft=ft)
Pr(Tp | Ns=ns, B=b)
Pr(Tp | Ns=ns, Ft=ft)
Pr(Tp | B=b, Ft=ft)

Pr(Tp | Ct=ct, Sst=sst, Ns=ns)

...etc. and thes only for one query variable Timber products. However because of independencies among variables, a lot of these conditional 
probabilities are redundant. For instance we have that:

Pr(Tp | Sst=sst, Ns=ns) = Pr(Tp | Sst=sst) 

knowing the number of storeys does not change the prob of timber products if superstruct type is known. 
Timber prod is independent of Num storeys given Superstr type.

These independencies can be 
read directly from the graph using d-separation algorithm.

!!! explain all of the above when talking about making queries (and report all the independencies in the appendix).
!!! for this proof-of-concep implement ad-hoc metods for few queries for all 5 variables...so to show in the paper and to report 
the variable elimination (belief propagation) steps in the appendix.
